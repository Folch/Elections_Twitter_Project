# Main Goal
**Identifying blue and red states** By combining sentiment analysis and geo-info, can we get an idea of how much a candidate is liked/disliked in a state? How does this compare to election results 
**Put more essential stuff here** 

# Interesting Statistics 
- **Who likes to tweet? (Savvina)** The average number of tweets per inhabitant for each state.
- **Peaks and valleys of activity.** At what time of the day do people tweet (on an hourly scale and dayly scale). 
- **Retweetable?** Which kind of tweets are retweated the most. Are neutral tweet more or less likely to be retweeted than positive and negative tweets?
- **International preferences.** Do other countries tend to side with Hillary, Trump, or both? Which countries engaged most with the elections on twitter, and why. Are first world countries more likely to engage, or is it more dependent on geographical locations?
- **Mexico?** Are there any interesting patterns involving Mexico. Are there correlations of the number of Mexican tweets and controversial statements corcerning Mexico made by the candidates. 
- **Gender identification. (Max)** ✅ Whose used twitter most during the elections, men or women? What are the differences in candidate preference and twitter behavior between men and women. 
- **Nationwide opinion on candidates.** When analyzing the sentiment of all tweets in the data, are there interesting patterns, such as a widespread like or dislike of candidates? Does this correspond to the final aggregated votes.?

- **Optimists or pessimists? (Albert)** ✅  What is the total amount of positive/negative tweets?
- **News Agencies (Elena)**. What is the percentage of tweets that originate from news agencies. How does this compare to the tweets originating from normal users.
